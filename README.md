# Package ONTOX

## For merging and visualizing SBtab files

The functions within this package can be used to merge and visualize
SBtab files as provided by the SysRev platform. It has originally been
made as part of a Data Science project for the University of Applied
Sciences in Utrecht.

## Installation

The development version of PackageONTOX can be installed from
[GitHub](https://github.com/) by using:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("ProjecticumDataScience/PackageONTOX")
```

# Contents

The package currently contains the following functions:
<ul>
<li>
Merging:
<ul>
<li>
sep_sbtab
</li>
<li>
prep_merge
</li>
<li>
merge_prepped
</li>
<li>
merge_sbtab
</li>
</ul>
<li>
Visualizations:
<ul>
<li>
net_graph
</li>
<li>
merged_net_graph
</li>
</ul>
</ul>

Together they create a possible workflow as described in figure 1.

![Figure 1. The workflow and usage process of the seperate functions.
Each function creates an output which can be used for another
function.](man/figures/workflow_visual.jpg)

The package also contains a variety of data files:

## [External data](https://github.com/ProjecticumDataScience/PackageONTOX/inst/extdata)

All files used as examples are stored in inst/extdata/. This includes
the following:
<ul>
<li>
4 .tsv files containing the original SBtabâ€™s as provided by M. Teunis
from University of Applied Sciences Utrecht.
</li>
<li>
3 .rds files starting with physmap6\_\*. These were acquired using the
sep_sbtab function.
</li>
<li>
2 .rds files starting with prepped\_\*. These were acquired using the
prep_merge function.
</li>
<li>
6 .rds files starting with merged\_\*. These were aquired using the
merge_sbtab function.
</li>

Aside from the files being the input and ouput for the merging
functions, they are also used by the visualization functions as shown
below. The filepaths will be turned into values with the corresponding
filename to keep the examples later on more clear.

``` r
library(PackageONTOX)

# Example files for sep_sbtab and merge_sbtab
physmap6 <- system.file("extdata", "physmap6.tsv", package="PackageONTOX")
physmap7 <- system.file("extdata", "physmap7.tsv", package="PackageONTOX")
physmap8 <- system.file("extdata", "physmap8.tsv", package="PackageONTOX")
physmap9 <- system.file("extdata", "physmap9.tsv", package="PackageONTOX")

# Example files for prep_merge

                                package="PackageONTOX")

# Example files for merge_prepped
prepped_physmap6_reactions <- system.file("extdata",
                                          "prepped_physmap6_reactions.rds", 
                                          package="PackageONTOX")

                                          package="PackageONTOX")

# Example files for net_graph

                              package="PackageONTOX")
physmap6_species <- system.file("extdata", "physmap6_species.rds", 
                                package="PackageONTOX")
physmap6_compartments <- system.file("extdata", "physmap6_compartments.rds", 
                                     package="PackageONTOX")

# Example files for merged_net_graph
merged_physmap67_edges <- system.file("extdata",
                                      "merged_physmap67_edges.rds", 
                                      package="PackageONTOX")
merged_physmap67_species <- system.file("extdata", 
                                        "merged_physmap67_species.rds", 
                                        package="PackageONTOX")
merged_physmap67_compartments <- system.file("extdata",
                                             "merged_physmap67_compartments.rds",

## prep_merge

## merge_prepped

## merge_sbtab

To be added.

## net_graph

After separating the SBtab file into various parts, the edges, species
and compartments list will be used to generate a network graph of a
single file. The function alters the data as fitting and converts it
into a object suitable for the graph. The graph is pre-set with a
fitting lay-out, edges that direct which way the reaction is headed,
nodes that are colored based on where they are found in the cell/body
and names of the involved substances.

``` r
net_graph(physmap6_edges, physmap6_species, physmap6_compartments)
```

## merged_net_graph

This function is mostly similar to the net_graph function. The
difference is that this function is used after merging multiple SBtab
files. Therefore the edges, species and compartments lists of the merged
files will be used to create a network graph of multiple files merged
together. An addition to this function is that the shape of the nodes
represent the original files.

``` r
merged_net_graph(merged_physmap67_edges, merged_physmap67_species, merged_physmap67_compartments)
```
